# Technical Research Step 5: Technical Synthesis and Completion

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without web search verification

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure the entire file is read and understood before proceeding
- ✅ Search the web to verify and supplement your knowledge with current facts
- 📋 YOU ARE A TECHNICAL RESEARCH STRATEGIST, not content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on comprehensive technical synthesis and authoritative conclusions
- 🔍 WEB SEARCH REQUIRED - verify current facts against live sources
- 📄 PRODUCE COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT with narrative intro, TOC, and summary
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show web search analysis before presenting findings
- ⚠️ Present [C] complete option after synthesis content generation
- 💾 ONLY save when user chooses C (Complete)
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` before completing workflow
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to complete workflow until C is selected
- 📚 GENERATE COMPLETE DOCUMENT STRUCTURE with intro, TOC, and summary

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Current document and frontmatter from previous steps are available
- **Research topic = "{{research_topic}}"** - comprehensive technical analysis
- **Research goals = "{{research_goals}}"** - achieved through exhaustive technical research
- All technical research sections have been completed (overview, architecture, implementation)
- Web search capabilities with source verification are enabled
- This is the final synthesis step producing the complete technical research document

## YOUR TASK:

Produce a comprehensive, authoritative technical research document on **{{research_topic}}** with compelling narrative introduction, detailed TOC, and executive summary based on exhaustive technical research.

## COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL DOCUMENT SYNTHESIS:

### 1. Load Technical Research Document Template

**Template Location:**
`data/technical-research-document-template.md`

Read the complete technical research document template from the data file. This template provides:

- Complete 12-section document structure
- Executive summary format
- Comprehensive table of contents
- Section-by-section templates with placeholders
- Source citation formats
- Quality standards and methodology framework

### 2. Generate Compelling Technical Introduction

**Technical Introduction Requirements:**

- Hook reader with compelling technical opening about {{research_topic}}
- Establish technical research significance and current relevance
- Outline comprehensive technical research methodology
- Preview key technical findings and strategic implications
- Set authoritative, technical expert tone

**Web Search for Technical Introduction Context:**
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} technical significance importance"

### 3. Synthesize All Technical Research Sections

**Technical Section-by-Section Integration:**

- Combine technical overview from step-02
- Integrate architectural patterns from step-03
- Incorporate implementation research from step-04
- Add cross-technical insights and connections
- Ensure comprehensive technical coverage with no gaps

### 4. Generate Complete Technical Document Content

Using the template structure from `data/technical-research-document-template.md`:

1. **Replace all placeholders** ({{research_topic}}, {{research_goals}}, {{date}})
2. **Fill each of the 12 sections** with synthesized technical content
3. **Maintain source citations** throughout with verified web sources
4. **Ensure comprehensive coverage** across all technical aspects
5. **Generate compelling narrative** that flows from introduction to conclusion
6. **Include executive summary** highlighting key findings and recommendations

### 5. Present Complete Technical Document and Final Option

**Technical Document Completion Presentation:**

"I've completed the **comprehensive technical research document synthesis** for **{{research_topic}}**, producing an authoritative technical research document with:

**Technical Document Features:**

- **Compelling Technical Introduction**: Engaging technical opening that establishes research significance
- **Comprehensive Technical TOC**: Complete navigation structure for technical reference
- **Exhaustive Technical Research Coverage**: All technical aspects of {{research_topic}} thoroughly analyzed
- **Executive Technical Summary**: Key technical findings and strategic implications highlighted
- **Strategic Technical Recommendations**: Actionable technical insights based on comprehensive research
- **Complete Technical Source Citations**: Every technical claim verified with current sources

**Technical Research Completeness:**

- Technical landscape and architecture analysis fully documented
- Implementation approaches and best practices comprehensively covered
- Technology stack evolution and trends detailed
- Integration, performance, and security analysis complete
- Strategic technical insights and implementation guidance provided

**Technical Document Standards Met:**

- Exhaustive technical research with no critical gaps
- Professional technical structure and compelling narrative
- As long as needed for comprehensive technical coverage
- Multiple independent technical sources for all claims
- current technical data throughout with proper citations

[C] Complete Research - Save final comprehensive technical document

### 6. Handle Final Technical Completion

#### If 'C' (Complete Research):

- Append the complete technical document to the research file
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Complete the technical research workflow
- Provide final technical document delivery confirmation

## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:

When user selects 'C', append the complete comprehensive technical research document generated from the template in `data/technical-research-document-template.md`.

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Compelling technical introduction with research significance
✅ Comprehensive technical table of contents with complete document structure
✅ Exhaustive technical research coverage across all technical aspects
✅ Executive technical summary with key findings and strategic implications
✅ Strategic technical recommendations grounded in comprehensive research
✅ Complete technical source verification with current citations
✅ Professional technical document structure and compelling narrative
✅ [C] complete option presented and handled correctly
✅ Technical research workflow completed with comprehensive document

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not producing compelling technical introduction
❌ Missing comprehensive technical table of contents
❌ Incomplete technical research coverage across technical aspects
❌ Not providing executive technical summary with key findings
❌ Missing strategic technical recommendations based on research
❌ Relying solely on training data without web verification for current facts
❌ Producing technical document without professional structure
❌ Not presenting completion option for final technical document

❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions
❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file
❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols

## COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL DOCUMENT STANDARDS:

This step ensures the final technical research document:

- Serves as an authoritative technical reference on {{research_topic}}
- Provides strategic technical insights for informed decision-making

- Meets professional technical research document quality standards

## TECHNICAL RESEARCH WORKFLOW COMPLETION:

When 'C' is selected:

- All technical research steps completed (1-5)
- Comprehensive technical research document generated
- Professional technical document structure with intro, TOC, and summary
- All technical sections appended with source citations
- Technical research workflow status updated to complete
- Final comprehensive technical research document delivered to user

## FINAL TECHNICAL DELIVERABLE:

Complete authoritative technical research document on {{research_topic}} that:

- Establishes technical credibility through comprehensive research
- Provides strategic technical insights for informed decision-making
- Serves as technical reference document for continued use
- Maintains highest technical research quality standards with current verification
