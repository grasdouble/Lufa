# Domain Research Step 6: Research Synthesis and Completion

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without web search verification

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure the entire file is read and understood before proceeding
- ✅ Search the web to verify and supplement your knowledge with current facts
- 📋 YOU ARE A DOMAIN RESEARCH STRATEGIST, not content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on comprehensive synthesis and authoritative conclusions
- 🔍 WEB SEARCH REQUIRED - verify current facts against live sources
- 📄 PRODUCE COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT with narrative intro, TOC, and summary
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show web search analysis before presenting findings
- ⚠️ Present [C] complete option after synthesis content generation
- 💾 ONLY save when user chooses C (Complete)
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` before completing workflow
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to complete workflow until C is selected
- 📚 GENERATE COMPLETE DOCUMENT STRUCTURE with intro, TOC, and summary

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Current document and frontmatter from previous steps are available
- **Research topic = "{{research_topic}}"** - comprehensive domain analysis
- **Research goals = "{{research_goals}}"** - achieved through exhaustive research
- All domain research sections have been completed (analysis, regulatory, technical)
- Web search capabilities with source verification are enabled
- This is the final synthesis step producing the complete research document

## YOUR TASK:

Produce a comprehensive, authoritative research document on **{{research_topic}}** with compelling narrative introduction, detailed TOC, and executive summary based on exhaustive domain research.

## COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT SYNTHESIS:

### 1. Load Domain Research Document Template

**Template Location:**
`data/domain-research-document-template.md`

Read the complete domain research document template from the data file. This template provides:

- Complete 10-section document structure
- Executive summary format
- Comprehensive table of contents
- Section-by-section templates with placeholders
- Source citation formats
- Quality standards and methodology framework

### 2. Generate Compelling Narrative Introduction

**Introduction Requirements:**

- Hook reader with compelling opening about {{research_topic}}
- Establish research significance and timeliness
- Outline comprehensive research methodology
- Preview key findings and strategic implications
- Set professional, authoritative tone

**Web Search for Introduction Context:**
Search the web: "{{research_topic}} significance importance"

### 3. Synthesize All Research Sections

**Section-by-Section Integration:**

- Combine industry analysis from step-02
- Integrate regulatory focus from step-03
- Incorporate technical trends from step-04
- Add cross-sectional insights and connections
- Ensure comprehensive coverage with no gaps

### 4. Generate Complete Document Content

Using the template structure from `data/domain-research-document-template.md`:

1. **Replace all placeholders** ({{research_topic}}, {{research_goals}}, {{date}})
2. **Fill each of the 10 sections** with synthesized domain content
3. **Maintain source citations** throughout with verified web sources
4. **Ensure comprehensive coverage** across all domain aspects
5. **Generate compelling narrative** that flows from introduction to conclusion
6. **Include executive summary** highlighting key findings and recommendations

### 5. Present Complete Document and Final Option

**Document Completion Presentation:**

"I've completed the **comprehensive research document synthesis** for **{{research_topic}}**, producing an authoritative research document with:

**Document Features:**

- **Compelling Narrative Introduction**: Engaging opening that establishes research significance
- **Comprehensive Table of Contents**: Complete navigation structure for easy reference
- **Exhaustive Research Coverage**: All aspects of {{research_topic}} thoroughly analyzed
- **Executive Summary**: Key findings and strategic implications highlighted
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Actionable insights based on comprehensive research
- **Complete Source Citations**: Every factual claim verified with sources

**Research Completeness:**

- Industry analysis and market dynamics fully documented
- Technology trends and innovation landscape comprehensively covered
- Regulatory framework and compliance requirements detailed
- Competitive landscape and ecosystem analysis complete
- Strategic insights and implementation guidance provided

**Document Standards Met:**

- Exhaustive research with no critical gaps
- Professional structure and compelling narrative
- As long as needed for comprehensive coverage
- Multiple independent sources for all claims
- Proper citations throughout

**Ready to complete this comprehensive research document?**
[C] Complete Research - Save final comprehensive document

### 6. Handle Final Completion

#### If 'C' (Complete Research):

- Append the complete document to the research file
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Complete the domain research workflow
- Provide final document delivery confirmation

## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:

When user selects 'C', append the complete comprehensive research document generated from the template in `data/domain-research-document-template.md`.

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ Compelling narrative introduction with research significance
✅ Comprehensive table of contents with complete document structure
✅ Exhaustive research coverage across all domain aspects
✅ Executive summary with key findings and strategic implications
✅ Strategic recommendations grounded in comprehensive research
✅ Complete source verification with citations
✅ Professional document structure and compelling narrative
✅ [C] complete option presented and handled correctly
✅ Domain research workflow completed with comprehensive document

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Not producing compelling narrative introduction
❌ Missing comprehensive table of contents
❌ Incomplete research coverage across domain aspects
❌ Not providing executive summary with key findings
❌ Missing strategic recommendations based on research
❌ Relying solely on training data without web verification for current facts
❌ Producing document without professional structure
❌ Not presenting completion option for final document

❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions
❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file
❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols

## COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT STANDARDS:

This step ensures the final research document:

- Serves as an authoritative reference on {{research_topic}}
- Provides compelling narrative and professional structure
- Includes comprehensive coverage with no gaps
- Maintains rigorous source verification standards
- Delivers strategic insights and actionable recommendations
- Meets professional research document quality standards

## DOMAIN RESEARCH WORKFLOW COMPLETION:

When 'C' is selected:

- All domain research steps completed (1-5)
- Comprehensive domain research document generated
- Professional document structure with intro, TOC, and summary
- All sections appended with source citations
- Domain research workflow status updated to complete
- Final comprehensive research document delivered to user

## FINAL DELIVERABLE:

Complete authoritative research document on {{research_topic}} that:

- Establishes professional credibility through comprehensive research
- Provides strategic insights for informed decision-making
- Serves as reference document for continued use
- Maintains highest research quality standards

Congratulations on completing comprehensive domain research! 🎉
