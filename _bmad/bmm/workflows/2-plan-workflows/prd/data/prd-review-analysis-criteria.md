# PRD Review & Analysis Criteria

This document defines the analysis criteria and change plan structure for PRD deep reviews.

## BMAD Standards Analysis Criteria

When analyzing a PRD against BMAD standards, identify issues in:

- **Information density (anti-patterns)**: Filler text, redundant explanations
- **Structure and flow**: Logical organization, clear progression
- **Completeness (missing sections/content)**: Required sections present
- **Measurability (unmeasurable requirements)**: All requirements testable
- **Traceability (broken chains)**: Clear links between requirements
- **Implementation leakage**: Requirements focus on "what", not "how"

## Change Plan Template Structure

For each PRD section in the change plan:

- **Current State**: Brief description of what exists
- **Issues Identified**: [List from validation report or manual analysis]
- **Changes Needed**: [Specific changes required]
- **Priority**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- **User Requirements Met**: [Which user edit goals address this section]

### Types of Changes to Include

- **Sections to add**: If missing required content
- **Sections to update**: If present but needs work
- **Content to remove**: If incorrect/leakage detected
- **Structure changes**: If reformatting needed
