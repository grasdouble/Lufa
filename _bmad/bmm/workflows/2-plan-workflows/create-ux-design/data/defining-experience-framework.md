# Defining Experience Framework

This framework guides UX facilitators through identifying and defining the core interaction that makes a product successful. It focuses on the defining experience - the core interaction that, if nailed, makes everything else follow.

---

## Famous Product Examples

Every successful product has a defining experience. Here are examples:

- **Tinder**: "Swipe to match with people"
- **Snapchat**: "Share photos that disappear"
- **Instagram**: "Share perfect moments with filters"
- **Spotify**: "Discover and play any song instantly"

## 1. Identifying the Defining Experience

Focus on the core interaction that users will describe to their friends.

### Key Questions:

- What's the core action that users will describe to their friends?
- What's the interaction that makes users feel successful?
- If we get ONE thing perfectly right, what should it be?

### Facilitation Approach:

"Every successful product has a defining experience - the core interaction that, if we nail it, everything else follows.

**Think about these famous examples:**

- Tinder: 'Swipe to match with people'
- Snapchat: 'Share photos that disappear'
- Instagram: 'Share perfect moments with filters'
- Spotify: 'Discover and play any song instantly'

**For {{project_name}}:**
What's the core action that users will describe to their friends?
What's the interaction that makes users feel successful?
If we get ONE thing perfectly right, what should it be?"

## 2. Exploring User Mental Model

Understand how users think about the core task and what mental models they bring.

### Mental Model Questions:

- How do users currently solve this problem?
- What mental model do they bring to this task?
- What's their expectation for how this should work?
- Where are they likely to get confused or frustrated?

### Current Solutions Analysis:

- What do users love/hate about existing approaches?
- What shortcuts or workarounds do they use?
- What makes existing solutions feel magical or terrible?

### Facilitation Script:

**Current Solutions:**

- What shortcuts or workarounds do they use?
- What makes existing solutions feel magical or terrible?"

## 3. Success Criteria for Core Experience

Establish what makes the core interaction successful from the user's perspective.

### Success Questions:

- What makes users say "this just works"?
- When do they feel smart or accomplished?
- What feedback tells them they're doing it right?
- How fast should it feel?
- What should happen automatically?

### Success Indicators Template:

```markdown

- What feedback tells them they're doing it right?
- How fast should it feel?
- What should happen automatically?

## 4. Novel vs. Established Patterns Analysis

Determine if innovation is needed or if proven patterns can be used.

### Pattern Analysis Framework:

Looking at the core experience, does this:

- Use established UX patterns that users already understand?
- Require novel interaction design that needs user education?
- Combine familiar patterns in innovative ways?

### If Novel Patterns Required:

- What makes this different from existing approaches?
- How will we teach users this new pattern?
- What familiar metaphors can we use?

### If Established Patterns:

- Which proven patterns should we adopt?
- How can we innovate within familiar patterns?
- What's our unique twist on established interactions?

### Facilitation Script:

## 5. Experience Mechanics Breakdown

Break down the core interaction into four detailed phases.

### Four Phases of Experience:

#### 1. Initiation

- How does the user start this action?
- What triggers or invites them to begin?

#### 2. Interaction

- What does the user actually do?
- What controls or inputs do they use?
- How does the system respond?

#### 3. Feedback

- What tells users they're succeeding?
- How do they know when it's working?
- What happens if they make a mistake?

#### 4. Completion

- How do users know they're done?
- What's the successful outcome?
- What's next?

### Facilitation Template:

"**Core Experience Mechanics:**
Let's design the step-by-step flow for [defining experience]:

**1. Initiation:**

- How does the user start this action?
- What triggers or invites them to begin?

**2. Interaction:**

- What does the user actually do?
- What controls or inputs do they use?
- How does the system respond?

**3. Feedback:**

- What tells users they're succeeding?
- How do they know when it's working?
- What happens if they make a mistake?

**4. Completion:**

- How do users know they're done?
- What's the successful outcome?
- What's next?"

## Usage Notes for Step Files

**This framework should be referenced when:**

- Facilitating the defining experience conversation (Step 7)
- Evaluating if the core interaction is clearly defined
- Analyzing whether experience mechanics are sufficiently detailed

**Step files should:**

1. Reference this framework in frontmatter under `data_files`
2. Use abbreviated versions of questions in step logic
3. Link to specific sections when detailed templates are needed
4. Keep workflow-specific logic in step file, not here
