# LUFA

LUFA is a mono repo without a lens except to satisfy its owner.

</p>

It's composed to:

- a design system (almost, there are only a few components)
- a storybook (to play with components of the design system, accessible with the url [www.sebastien-lemouillour.fr/storybook](https://www.sebastien-lemouillour.fr/storybook))
- a backpack of shared config (eslint, typescript, ...)
- a todo list (just in case I have ideas but not time to test them)
- a doc folder (it's not a promise, but I will try to document things interesting for me)
- a poc folder (without surprise, it's to do POC)
- a microfrontend (accessible with the url [www.sebastien-lemouillour.fr](https://www.sebastien-lemouillour.fr))

## Why

I started a lot of projects (some still available on Github), but most of them have not been completed. It was due to a lack of time (and also because I tested enough things to be able to discuss it a little during a coffee break).

After doing this conclusion, I decided to bring together all the new projects in a mono-repository.
It will help me keep an eye on the oldest projects and keep them up to date.
