# LUFA

Lufa is a monorepo without lens, except maybe to test everything

It's composed to:

- a design system (almost, there is only few components)
- a storybook (to play with component of the design-system)
- a backpack of shared config (eslint, typescript, ...)
- a todo list (just in case, I have ideas but not time to test them)
- a doc folder (it's not a promise but I will try to document things interesting for me)

## Why

I started a lot of projects (some still available on Github), but most of them have not been completed. It was due to a lack of time (and also because I tested enough things to be able to discuss it a little during a coffee break).

After doing this conclusion, I decided to bring together all the new projects in a mono-repository.
It will help me keep an eye on the oldest projects and keep them up to date.
