# Archived Prompts

This directory contains prompt files that are no longer actively used but are preserved for historical reference.

## Files

### tailwindcss-convert.prompt.md

- **Archived**: January 2026
- **Reason**: No longer relevant for Lufa Design System after Tailwind CSS removal
- **Replacement**: Use CSS Modules with token-based styling (see `lufa-design-system.instructions.md`)

## About Archived Prompts

Archived prompt files:

- Are no longer listed in the active prompts index (`.github/prompts/README.md`)
- Contain a prominent archive banner at the top
- Include `archived: true` and `archived_reason` in YAML frontmatter
- Are kept for historical reference and context
- May be useful when working with legacy projects or understanding past workflows

## Restoring Archived Prompts

If a prompt becomes relevant again:

1. Review the archived prompt for outdated information
2. Update content to reflect current tools and practices
3. Remove archive banner and frontmatter flags
4. Move back to parent `.github/prompts/` directory
5. Add to prompts index in `.github/prompts/README.md`
