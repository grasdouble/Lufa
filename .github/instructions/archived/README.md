# Archived Instructions

This directory contains instruction files that are no longer actively used but are preserved for historical reference.

## Files

### tailwindcss.instructions.md

- **Archived**: January 2026
- **Reason**: Lufa Design System migrated from Tailwind CSS to vanilla CSS with CSS Modules
- **Replacement**: Use CSS Modules with token-based styling (see `lufa-design-system.instructions.md`)

## About Archived Files

Archived instruction files:

- Are no longer loaded by AI coding agents for active file paths
- Contain a prominent archive banner at the top
- Include `archived: true` and `archived_reason` in YAML frontmatter
- Are kept for historical reference and context
- May be useful when reviewing legacy code or understanding past architectural decisions

## Restoring Archived Files

If a technology or pattern becomes relevant again:

1. Review the archived file for outdated information
2. Update content to reflect current standards
3. Remove archive banner and frontmatter flags
4. Move back to parent `.github/instructions/` directory
5. Update related documentation (AGENTS.md, etc.)
