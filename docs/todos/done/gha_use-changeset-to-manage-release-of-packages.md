# Steps to Use Changesets to Manage Releases in a pnpm Monorepo

## What is Changesets?

Changesets is a tool designed to manage versioning and changelogs in monorepos or multi-package repositories. It simplifies the process of tracking changes, bumping versions, and generating changelogs for packages in a structured and automated way. By using Changesets, developers can ensure consistent versioning and clear documentation of changes across all packages in the repository.

### Why Use Changesets?

- **Version Control**: Automatically updates package versions based on the type of changes (major, minor, patch).
- **Changelog Generation**: Creates detailed changelogs for each package, making it easier to track changes.
- **Monorepo Support**: Works seamlessly with monorepos, where multiple packages are managed in a single repository.
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to configure workflows and customize changelog formats.

## Alternatives to Changesets

While Changesets is a popular choice, there are other tools available for managing versioning and releases in monorepos. Below is a comparison of some alternatives, including their compatibility with monorepos:

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Changesets**       | Versioning, changelog generation, monorepo support, customizable | Easy to use, great for monorepos, integrates well with CI/CD pipelines | Requires manual creation of changesets for each change                                    | ✅ Yes                        |
| **Lerna**            | Versioning, publishing, monorepo management                      | Built-in support for monorepos, automates versioning and publishing    | Less flexible changelog generation, requires additional setup for changelog customization | ✅ Yes                        |
| **Standard Version** | Versioning, changelog generation based on commit messages        | Simple setup, works well with conventional commits                     | Requires strict adherence to conventional commit messages                                 | ❌ No                         |
| **Semantic Release** | Fully automated versioning and publishing                        | Fully automates the release process, integrates with CI/CD pipelines   | Complex setup, requires configuration for monorepos                                       | ⚠️ Partial (requires plugins) |
| **Auto**             | Automated versioning, changelog generation, GitHub integration   | Highly customizable, supports plugins for extended functionality       | Steeper learning curve, less widely adopted                                               | ✅ Yes                        |

### When to Choose Each Tool

- **Changesets**: Best for teams using monorepos who want fine-grained control over versioning and changelogs.
- **Lerna**: Ideal for managing monorepos with simpler versioning and publishing needs.
- **Standard Version**: Suitable for projects using conventional commits and requiring minimal setup.
- **Semantic Release**: Great for teams looking for a fully automated release process, especially for single-package repositories or monorepos with additional configuration.
- **Auto**: Perfect for advanced users who need extensive customization and GitHub integration.

By understanding the strengths, weaknesses, and monorepo compatibility of each tool, you can choose the one that best fits your project's requirements and workflow.

## 1. **Install Changesets**

- Add Changesets as a development dependency in your monorepo:
  ```bash
  pnpm add @changesets/cli -D -w
  ```
- Initialize Changesets in your repository:
  ```bash
  pnpm changeset init
  ```
- This will create a `.changeset` folder in the root of your monorepo.

## 2. **Create a Changeset**

- Whenever you make changes to your packages, create a new changeset:
  ```bash
  pnpm changeset
  ```
- Follow the prompts to specify which packages were changed and the type of version bump (major, minor, or patch).
- A new markdown file will be created in the `.changeset` folder describing the changes.

## 3. **Commit the Changeset**

- Commit the generated changeset file along with your code changes:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add changeset for [description of changes]"
  ```

## 4. **Versioning and Changelog Generation**

- When you're ready to release, run the following command to bump versions and generate changelogs:
  ```bash
  pnpm changeset version
  ```
- This will:
  - Update the versions of the affected packages in their `package.json` files.
  - Generate changelog entries for the changes in each package.

## 5. **Publish the Packages**

- Publish the updated packages to the npm registry:
  ```bash
  pnpm publish -r
  ```
- The `-r` flag ensures that all updated packages in the monorepo are published.

## 6. **Clean Up Changesets**

- After publishing, the changeset files in the `.changeset` folder are no longer needed.
- You can safely remove them or leave them for historical reference.

## 7. **Automating Releases (Optional)**

- Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the versioning and publishing process.
- Use the `changeset publish` command in your CI pipeline to handle releases automatically.

## 8. **Best Practices**

- Always create a changeset for any change that affects the public API of your packages.
- Review the generated changelogs to ensure they accurately describe the changes.
- Use semantic versioning principles to determine the appropriate version bump.
