# Proof of Concept: Generate TypeScript Type Definitions Based on Backend via Swagger or Alternative Methods

## Goal

The purpose of this Proof of Concept (POC) is to explore and implement a solution for automatically generating TypeScript type definitions from backend APIs. This ensures that the frontend and backend remain in sync, reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of type mismatches.

## Key Objectives

1. **Automate Type Generation**: Use tools or libraries to generate TypeScript types directly from backend API specifications.
2. **Swagger/OpenAPI Integration**: Leverage Swagger (or OpenAPI) documentation as the primary source for type generation.
3. **Alternative Approaches**: Investigate other methods (e.g., GraphQL schemas, custom scripts) if Swagger/OpenAPI is not available.
4. **Improve Developer Productivity**: Streamline the development process by reducing manual type creation and maintenance.
5. **Ensure Type Safety**: Enhance type safety in the frontend by aligning with backend API contracts.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this POC, we should have:

- A working solution to generate TypeScript type definitions from backend APIs.
- A clear understanding of the tools and workflows required for integration.
- Documentation on how to implement and maintain the solution in a real-world project.

## Tools and Libraries to Explore

- **Swagger Codegen**: Generate TypeScript types from Swagger/OpenAPI specs.
- **openapi-typescript**: A lightweight tool to convert OpenAPI specs to TypeScript types.
- **GraphQL Code Generator**: If the backend uses GraphQL, this tool can generate TypeScript types from GraphQL schemas.
- **Custom Scripts**: Write custom scripts to parse backend API responses and generate types.

## Next Steps

1. Identify the backend API specification format (e.g., Swagger, OpenAPI, GraphQL).
2. Research and evaluate tools for type generation.
3. Implement a basic example to validate the approach.
4. Document the findings and finalize the recommended solution.
