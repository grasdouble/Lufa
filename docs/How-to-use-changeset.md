# How to Use Changeset

A changeset is a way to manage and track changes in a project, especially when working with versioning and publishing tools. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to use changesets effectively:

## Step 2: Create a Changeset

Whenever you make changes that need to be tracked, create a new changeset:

```bash
npx changeset
```

You will be prompted to select the packages you want to include in the changeset, specify the type of change (major, minor, or patch), and provide a summary of the changes.

## Step 2: Commit the Changeset

After creating a changeset, commit the changes to your version control system:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add changeset for [description of changes]"
```

## Step 3: Bump Versions

When you're ready to release, bump the versions of the packages based on the changesets:

```bash
npx changeset version
```

This updates the package versions and generates changelogs.

## Step 4: Publish the Changes

Finally, publish the updated packages:

```bash
npx changeset publish
```

This will publish the packages to your package registry (e.g., npm).

## Additional Tips

- Regularly review and clean up unused changesets.
- Use changesets in combination with CI/CD pipelines for automated versioning and publishing.
