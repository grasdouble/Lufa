/**
 * Default Theme
 *
 * Color overrides for the default theme are provided by the token package
 * via tokens.css (--lufa-core-*, --lufa-semantic-*, --lufa-component-*).
 *
 * Theme-specific overrides (e.g., ocean, nordic) are defined in the
 * @lufa/themes package using the --lufa-core-* token layer.
 *
 * This file is intentionally empty. It was previously used to define
 * --lufa-token-* custom properties which have been removed in favor
 * of the standard token hierarchy.
