# Microfrontend

## Context

This folder contains the implementation of a microfrontend architecture.

It includes modules and components designed to be independently developed, deployed, and integrated into a larger application.

The goal is to enable scalability and maintainability by breaking down the application into smaller, manageable pieces.

## Description

### main-container

The `main-container` is the core module responsible for orchestrating the integration of various microfrontend components. It acts as the host application, providing shared services, routing, and communication mechanisms to ensure seamless interaction between the microfrontends.

### home

The `home` module represents the landing page or entry point of the application. It provides the initial user interface and serves as a starting point for navigation to other microfrontend components. This module typically includes shared layouts, headers, and footers.
