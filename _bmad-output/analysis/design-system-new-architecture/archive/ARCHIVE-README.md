# Archive - BMM Analysis Documents

**Archive Date:** 2026-01-24  
**Reason:** Transition to consolidated documentation

---

## What's Archived Here

This directory contains historical BMM (Business Management Method) analysis documents that were used during the **initial planning and analysis phase** of the Lufa Design System v2.0 project (January 2024).

### Archived Files

1. **`MASTER-STATUS.md`** (42 KB, 1,151 lines)
   - Complete project status as of 2026-01-24
   - Phase-by-phase breakdown (Phases 0-8)
   - Detailed metrics and progress tracking
   - Architectural decisions documentation

2. **`roadmap-implementation-v2.0.md`** (43 KB, 1,125 lines)
   - Detailed implementation roadmap
   - Phase definitions and deliverables
   - Timeline and effort estimates
   - Risk analysis and mitigation strategies

### Why Were These Archived?

These documents served their purpose during the **BMM Document Project Workflow** (12-step analysis process). Their content has been **integrated and consolidated** into the official design system documentation:

- **Primary Source of Truth:** `packages/design-system/docs/roadmap-and-status.md`
- **Architectural Decisions:** `packages/design-system/docs/architecture.md`
- **Component Progress:** `packages/design-system/docs/component-inventory.md`
- **Project Overview:** `packages/design-system/docs/overview.md`

### When to Reference These Files

✅ **Use archived files for:**

- Historical context (understanding how decisions were made)
- Tracing the evolution of the project
- Understanding the BMM analysis methodology
- Comparing initial plans vs actual execution

❌ **Don't use archived files for:**

- Current project status (use `roadmap-and-status.md` instead)
- Implementation guidance (use official docs)
- Onboarding new contributors (use living documentation)
