# Current Work

This directory is reserved for documents related to ongoing, active work on the design system architecture project.

## Purpose

This directory should contain:

- Work-in-progress analysis documents
- Active phase planning documents
- Temporary notes and findings
- Documents being actively edited or reviewed

## Guidelines

- **Move to appropriate directory when complete**: Once work is finalized, move documents to:
  - `../summaries/` - For phase completion summaries
  - `../studies/` - For analysis, verification, and review documents
  - `../archive/` - For deprecated or superseded documents

- **Keep it clean**: This directory should only contain active work. Completed documents should be organized appropriately.

- **Naming convention**: Use descriptive names with dates when relevant:
  - `phase-X-work-in-progress.md`
  - `analysis-[topic]-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  - `review-draft-[topic].md`
