# Current Work

This directory is reserved for documents related to ongoing, active work on the {project name}.

---

## 📋 Purpose

This directory should contain:

- **Work-in-progress analysis documents** - Draft analysis being actively worked on
- **Active phase planning documents** - Planning for current phase
- **Temporary notes and findings** - Notes that will be organized later
- **Documents being actively edited or reviewed** - Documents in draft state

---

## 📂 Current Files

{Update this section as you add/remove files}

### Active Documents

{This will be populated as work begins. Examples:}

- `phase-N-work-in-progress.md` - Active phase work
- `analysis-{topic}-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Ongoing analysis
- `review-draft-{topic}.md` - Draft review document
- `notes-{session}.md` - Session notes

---

## ✅ Guidelines

### When to Use current/

✅ **Put files here when:**

- Starting new phase work (before it's complete)
- Working on draft analysis documents
- Collecting notes and findings during active work
- Creating temporary files that will be organized later
- Iterating on proposals or reviews

### When to Move Files Out

📦 **Move to summaries/ when:**

- Phase is complete → Create phase completion summary

📦 **Move to studies/ when:**

- Analysis is finalized → Becomes reference document
- Review is complete → Becomes reference material

📦 **Move to archive/ when:**

- Document is superseded by newer version
- Draft is no longer needed (final version exists elsewhere)
- Work direction changed (deprecated approach)

### Keep It Clean

⚠️ **Important:**

- This directory should be **regularly emptied** as work completes
- Aim for **≤3 active files** at any time
- If it's growing beyond that, organize files to their final homes
- Don't use current/ as permanent storage

---

## 📛 Naming Conventions

Use descriptive names that make it clear what the file is and when it was created:

- `phase-N-work-in-progress.md` - Active phase work
- `analysis-{topic}-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Dated analysis
- `review-draft-{topic}.md` - Draft reviews
- `notes-{session-name}.md` - Session notes
- `planning-phase-{N}.md` - Phase planning

---

## 🔄 Workflow

**Typical file lifecycle:**

```
1. Create file in current/
   ↓
2. Work on it (edit, iterate)
   ↓
3. Finalize document
   ↓
4. Move to appropriate directory:
   - summaries/ (if phase summary)
   - studies/ (if reference analysis)
   - archive/ (if superseded/deprecated)
   ↓
5. Update links in MASTER-STATUS.md if needed
   ↓
6. Git commit the move
```
