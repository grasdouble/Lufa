## About This Archive

This directory contains **intermediate summary documents** created during Phase 0 completion. These files have been archived because they are superseded by the comprehensive Phase 0 master summary.

### Archived Files

| File                                      | Date       | Content                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `phase-0-action-1-summary.md`             | 2026-01-22 | Performance POC (Action #1) only            |
| `phase-0-action-2-summary.md`             | 2026-01-22 | Metadata Automation (Action #2) only        |
| `phase-0-actions-1-2-complete-summary.md` | 2026-01-22 | Combined Actions #1 & #2 (before Action #3) |

### Master Reference (Not Archived)

**Use this file instead:** `_bmad-output/analysis/phase-0-complete-summary.md`

- ✅ All 3 actions (Action #1, #2, #3)
- ✅ Complete Phase 0 results
- ✅ Impact analysis
- ✅ Lessons learned
- ✅ All deliverables
- ✅ Next steps

## Why These Files Were Archived

### Duplication

Each archived file covered a subset of Phase 0 work:

- Action #1 only → Performance POC
- Action #2 only → Metadata Automation
- Actions #1 & #2 → Combined but missing Action #3

The master summary (`phase-0-complete-summary.md`) consolidates all three actions in a single, comprehensive document.

### Better Organization

Having 4 separate Phase 0 summaries created confusion about which file was the "source of truth." The master summary eliminates this ambiguity.

## When to Reference Archived Files

These archived files may be useful for:

- **Historical reference** - Understanding the sequential completion of Phase 0
- **Detailed action-specific info** - If you need deep-dive into a single action
- **Process documentation** - Studying incremental documentation approach

For most purposes, **use the master summary instead**.
