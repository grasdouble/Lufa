### When to Create a Summary

✅ **Create phase summary when:**

- Phase is 100% complete

- All phase objectives achieved
- Ready to transition to next phase

❌ **Don't create summary when:**

- Phase is still in progress (use current/ for WIP docs)
- Deliverables not yet validated
- Major blockers unresolved
