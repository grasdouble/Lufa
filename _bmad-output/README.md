## Guidelines

### 📁 What Goes Where

#### Phase Artifact Directories (Committed)

**`analysis/` - Phase 1 Analysis Outputs**

- Brainstorming session results
- Research findings
- Product briefs
- Competitive analysis

**`planning-artifacts/` - Phase 2 Planning Outputs**

- BMM workflow status (`bmm-workflow-status.yaml`)
- UX design specifications
- Product requirements documents (PRDs)
- Planning deliverables

**`implementation-artifacts/` - Phase 4 Implementation Outputs**

- Sprint plans and tracking
- Technical architecture documents
- Implementation decisions
- Sprint retrospectives

#### `tmp/` (Gitignored)

**Temporary session outputs that don't need to be committed:**

- Session summaries and progress reports
- Verification reports (unless needed for audit trail)
- Alignment reports (outdated after implementation)
- Analysis artifacts
- Planning session brainstorming outputs
- Work-in-progress documentation

**Examples:**

- `SESSION-CONTINUATION-SUMMARY-2026-01-25.md`
- `VERIFICATION-TOKENS-MULTIMODE-2026-01-25.md`
- `DESIGN-SYSTEM-ALIGNMENT-REPORT.md`
- `MULTI-MODE-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`

#### Root `_bmad-output/` (Committed)

**Permanent outputs that should be part of the repository:**

- **Phase artifacts** (organized in subdirectories by phase)
  - `analysis/` - Phase 1 outputs
  - `planning-artifacts/` - Phase 2 outputs (includes `bmm-workflow-status.yaml`)
  - `implementation-artifacts/` - Phase 4 outputs
- Final architecture decision documents (if not moved to official docs)
- Important audit trails or compliance reports
- Cross-session reference materials
- Tooling outputs that need version control

**Examples:**

- `planning-artifacts/bmm-workflow-status.yaml` - Current BMM methodology progress
- `analysis/brainstorming-session-*.md` - Analysis phase outputs

**When in doubt:** Put it in `tmp/` first. If you need it later, move it to appropriate phase folder or official docs.

### 🔄 File Lifecycle

```
1. Create → _bmad-output/tmp/          (temporary session output)
2. Review → Move to official docs      (if valuable for team)
   OR
2. Archive → Keep in tmp/              (gitignored, local only)
```

### 📋 Best Practices

1. **Session Reports** → Always `tmp/`
   - These document the work process, not the final result
   - Final results should be in official documentation

2. **Verification Reports** → Usually `tmp/`
   - Keep only if needed for compliance/audit
   - Tests and CI should verify current state

3. **Architecture Decisions** → Official docs
   - Move to `packages/design-system/_docs/brainstorming/`
   - Or relevant package documentation

4. **Alignment Reports** → `tmp/` (they become outdated)
   - Use as working documents during implementation
   - Once aligned, the code itself is the source of truth

### 🧹 Cleanup

The `tmp/` directory is gitignored. You can safely:

- Delete old session files
- Keep only recent work for reference
- Clean up periodically (e.g., monthly)
